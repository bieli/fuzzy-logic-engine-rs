## Motivations

Fuzzy logic has always fascinated me because it embraces the shades of gray that classical logic often ignores. 
Instead of forcing the world into rigid categories of `true` or `false`, it allows us to capture the subtlety of `"almost," "somewhat," and "mostly"`.
This mirrors how humans naturally think and make decisions, blending intuition with reasoning in a way that feels both elegant and practical.

In mathematics, fuzzy sets reveal a beauty where precision and vagueness coexist, showing that uncertainty can be modeled with rigor.
In engineering and computer science, fuzzy inference systems transform this beauty into real‑world impact, from robotics to finance to everyday decision support.

What excites me most is how fuzzy logic bridges disciplines: it is at once mathematical, philosophical, and deeply human.
It encourages us to see complexity not as a problem to eliminate, but as a richness to embrace and work with.
Every fuzzy rule feels like a small story about the world, capturing experience in a form that machines can understand.

Building this Rust library is my way of celebrating that elegance, while also making it accessible for modern, high‑performance applications.
Ultimately, fuzzy logic reminds us that the world is not binary, and that’s precisely what makes it so endlessly interesting.
